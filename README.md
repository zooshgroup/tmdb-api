<p align="center">A GraphQL API wrapper for The Movie DB built with <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/features/data-sources.html">Apollo Data Sources</a>.</p>

> Note: v3 is currently under development, meaning these docs are subject to change!

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Install dependencies by running `yarn`, then create a new file in the root directory named `.env`. You'll need to get an API key from The Movie DB in order to run any queries. For more information, please read the [Movie DB docs](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). Additionally, if you want to track usage metrics for your API, you'll need to get an API key from Apollo Graph Manager. For instructions on how to do that, please read the [Apollo Graph Manager docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graph-manager/). In your new `.env` file, copy + paste the following and replace the text following the `=` sign with your newly create API keys.

```
MOVIE_DB_API_V3_KEY=<insert your movie database v3 api key here>
# OR
MOVIE_DB_API_V4_KEY=<insert your movie database v4 api key here>
```

Once that's done, you can now start up a development server using `yarn start`. By default this will use Serverless Offline, but if you would instead like to use Netlify Lamba, you can run `yarn start:netlify` instead. Once the development server is listening, you can pull up a GraphQL Playground by visiting one of the following URLs:

Lambda: http://localhost:1337/dev
Netlify: http://localhost:1337/.netlify/functions/tmdb-api

## üïπÔ∏è Demo

You can try out the API using the GraphQL Playground hosted at https://tmdb-api.saeris.io/.netlify/functions/tmdb-api

## üß™ Testing

Testing is provided via `jest` and is pre-configured to run with `codecov` as well. While tests for this project are far from complete, they can be found under `src/__TEST__` and follow a naming format of `[filename].spec.ts`. Additionally, this project uses `eslint`, `typescript`, and `prettier`, all three of which are automatically run on each commit via `husky` + `lint-staged`. To manually lint and test, use the following commands:

Lint:
```bash
yarn lint
```

Typecheck:
```bash
yarn typecheck
```

Test and watch for changes:
```bash
yarn test:watch
```

Lint + Typecheck + Test:
```bash
yarn test
```

## üö¢ Deployment

To deploy the server, you'll need to follow the Serverless Framework's [Setup Guide](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/installation/) to deploy to AWS. If you'd rather use Netlify, you'll need to follow whichever method works best for your workflow. Refer to [Netlify's Docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/) for more information.

If you're deploying to AWS, you can use the following commands to deploy to Staging or Production:

Staging:
```bash
yarn deploy
```

Production:
```bash
yarn deploy:prod
```

Alternatively, if you're using Travis CI, you can deploy to both on each commit as part of your CI process by uncommenting the following lines inside `travis.yml`:

```yaml
deploy:
 # deploy develop to the staging environment
 - provider: script
   skip_cleanup: true
   script: yarn deploy:dev
   on:
     node: "12"
     branch: develop
 # deploy master to production
 - provider: script
   skip_cleanup: true
   script:
     - yarn deploy:prod
   on:
     node: "12"
     branch: master
```
